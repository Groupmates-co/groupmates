## How to contribute?

First of all, I invite you to try the [Demo](htts://groupmates.co) and see what Groupmates look like now. Once you're done, please go to the [Features](https://github.com/Groupmates-co/groupmates/wiki/Features---Roadmap) page of the wiki to see what features are implemented and what is missing.
